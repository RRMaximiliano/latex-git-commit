# Example code to include current git commit/SHA in compiled LaTeX document

This mwe uses the example created by `Kristoffer BjÃ¤rkefur` posted [here](https://gist.github.com/kbjarkefur/88820e5a5365b3f707b6b20aee57cf8a) to include an automatically updating link in a LaTeX compiled document that points to the last commit.

> I ignored the compiled pdf file, so git will stop tracking it everything I compile it.
